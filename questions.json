    "explanation": "First, ignore the decimals and multiply the numbers as if they are whole numbers. This gives us 3 * 5 = 15. Next, account for the decimal places in the original numbers. 3.2 has one decimal place, and 0.5 has one decimal place, giving us a total of two decimal places to include in the product. Place the decimal two places from the right in our result of 160, which transforms it into 1.60. 1.60 can be simplified to 1.6, as the trailing zero does not affect the value of the decimal."
